# Dungeon matrices are 10x10 - somewhat inconsistent texture convention from the rest of the game, for the sake of sanity and readability
# Entries are 0, N, S, E, W
#             0, 1, 2, 4, 8
# weight gives weight based on whether the value that is randomly picked is greater than the weight
#  ie with a weight of 1, the likelihood is is 2/12 since 0,1 are 2 values that are possible to be picked and the net weight is 12
#  ie with a weight of 5, the likelihood is 6/12 since 0,1,2,3,4,5 but 0,1 were used for the previous chunk, so it's really 2,3,4,5 or 4/12
#  and so on
# spawn enumerates to one of the locations defined
